This repo has the code and analysis to explore how creating artificial data (SMOTE) and different undersampling and oversampling approaches (CBO and CBU) can address class imbalance.
Logistic Regression is used as a proxy performance measure of the success of different sampling approaches.
The credit card fraud dataset, available on kaggle, was used for this analysis as it is a highly imbalanced dataset with very few instances of fraud as compared to the majority class. 


The repository has all notebooks and saved data in the analysis folder. 
I have not pushed the saved credit dataset as it is over the 100 MB limit. 

**Files**:


1. **complete_analysis**: 
This file has the complete code for the entire analysis. It also highlights relevant points from the report where required. 

2. **credit_dataset**: 
The scaled and processed credit CSV. This is only on my local system. However, running the complete_analysis file will save it on your system

3. **Da5401_as3_report**: 
Provides a detailed report that explains and compares each method used to address the class imbalance. Also, summarises key results from the code.
